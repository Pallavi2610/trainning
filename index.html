            <p>Given the current scenario, direct industry placements from college provide an opportunity to sharpen
                rusty skills and apply them in real-world situations. These placements, in turn, help to promote the
                institute's industrial image, resulting in better recruitment and accreditation. A positive image also
                attracts more motivated and ambitious prospective students. Institutes must have a college placement
                management system in place to smooth the system and improve students' placement experiences. This guide
                is all about placement management software, its features, benefits, and how it helps institutional
                stakeholders.</p>
